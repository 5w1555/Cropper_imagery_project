To-Do List for Cropping Logic Improvements
Week 1: Quick Wins for Reliability and Usability

Improve Error Handling (2 days)

Task: Enhance error messages in crop_frontal_image, crop_profile_image, crop_chin_image, crop_nose_image, and crop_below_lips_image to specify issues (e.g., “Missing mouth_left landmark” instead of generic “Lip landmarks missing”). Add fallback cropping using bounding box if landmarks fail in auto_crop.
Impact: Reduces user frustration by 10–20%, improving reliability for testing and freelancing.
Why Urgent: Ensures cropping functions work robustly, critical for independent testing without Gradio.


Add Preset System (2 days)

Task: Implement save/load for cropping settings (margins, offsets) in auto_crop, crop_frontal_image, and crop_profile_image using JSON. Include default presets (e.g., “Instagram: 20px margin, 1:1 ratio”).
Impact: Streamlines workflows, adding 10–15% value for professionals.
Why Urgent: Simplifies usage, making the tool market-ready for quick monetization via Gumroad.


Add Social Media Presets (2 days)

Task: Extend apply_aspect_ratio_filter to include aspect ratio presets for Instagram (1:1, 4:5), TikTok (9:16), and LinkedIn (1.91:1), callable from auto_crop.
Impact: Attracts social media users, expanding user base by 10–15%.
Why Urgent: Targets a large, immediate market, boosting freelance and software appeal.



Week 2: Speed and Format Reliability

Optimize I/O (3 days)

Task: Replace PIL resizing in read_image with OpenCV’s cv2.resize for faster scaling. Set JPEG quality=85 in save_image to reduce save time without quality loss.
Impact: Cuts I/O time by 10–20%, improving batch performance.
Why Urgent: Enhances speed for freelancing gigs processing multiple images.


Ensure Format Reliability (2 days)

Task: Test HEIC/RAW handling in read_image and save_image. Add fallbacks (e.g., convert HEIC to JPEG if pillow-heif fails, save TIFF for RAW if rawpy missing).
Impact: Reduces errors, improving reliability for photographers using HEIC/RAW.
Why Urgent: Prevents crashes during client work, ensuring consistent output.



Week 3–4: Accuracy and Performance

Fine-Tune RetinaFace (7 days)

Task: Fine-tune RetinaFace on WIDER FACE dataset to improve detection across lighting, angles, and skin tones. Add heuristic fallback in get_face_and_landmarks (e.g., adjust bounding box if confidence < 0.3).
Impact: Boosts cropping accuracy by 10–15%, vital for ML and portraits.
Why Urgent: Enhances core functionality, differentiating from competitors.


Implement Multiprocessing (4 days)

Task: Replace threading with multiprocessing for batch cropping in auto_crop and get_face_and_landmarks to leverage multi-core CPUs.
Impact: Reduces batch processing time by 30–50%, appealing to e-commerce users.
Why Urgent: Critical for handling large image sets, a key market need.


Optimize RetinaFace Inference (5 days)

Task: Switch to a lighter RetinaFace model (e.g., MobileNet-based) or convert to ONNX in get_face_and_landmarks. Cache model outputs for similar images in batches.
Impact: Speeds up detection by 20–40%, improving user experience.
Why Urgent: Accelerates core cropping logic, essential for professional use.



Month 2: Market-Driven Enhancements

Automate Cropping (5 days)

Task: Add auto-crop suggestions in auto_crop using OpenCV’s cv2.calcHist to optimize margins/offsets based on image histograms. Include batch renaming in save_image (e.g., “cropped_001.jpg”).
Impact: Saves time for e-commerce, increasing value by 15%.
Why Urgent: Meets automation demands, enhancing marketability.


Support ML Datasets (5 days)

Task: Extend get_face_and_landmarks to output precise landmark coordinates as JSON for ML datasets, with scriptable batch cropping in auto_crop.
Impact: Appeals to researchers, enabling $500–$1,000 licenses.
Why Urgent: Taps into a high-value niche, supporting long-term income.


E-commerce Integration (7 days)

Task: Create a script for Shopify API to automate product image cropping, callable from auto_crop and apply_aspect_ratio_filter.
Impact: Targets e-commerce, adding $200–$500/month potential revenue.
Why Urgent: Expands market, aligning with growing e-commerce needs.



Notes

Testing Without Gradio: Since Gradio isn’t launching, test cropping logic with a script (e.g., load image, call get_face_and_landmarks and auto_crop, save output). Check for dependency issues (PyTorch, pillow-heif, Byte64.txt).
Monetization: These improvements enable freelancing ($200–$1,000/month) and Gumroad sales ($35, $315–$945 for 10–30 sales). Start with tasks 1–3 for quick market entry.
Total Effort: ~34 days for core tasks (Weeks 1–4), ~17 days for Month 2 enhancements.
Impact: Increases speed (30–50% faster), accuracy (10–15% better), and usability (20–30% more accessible), ensuring market fit.
